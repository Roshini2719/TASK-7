Task Title: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
Browser Used: Microsoft Edge

 Objective
The goal of this task is to identify potentially harmful or unused browser extensions installed in Microsoft Edge, assess their permissions, and remove or flag those that pose a privacy or security risk.

Whether allowed in InPrivate mode

File size and developer info

Trust level (e.g., open-source, official developer, suspicious behavior)

Made decisions based on security risk and necessity.

Documented the findings for each extension.

Flagged or retained based on security best practices.

üîê Key Learnings
Extensions with broad or unclear permissions should be used cautiously.

Always verify the developer identity, reviews, and permissions.

Use InPrivate mode restrictions to limit unnecessary access.

Even small extensions can introduce security issues if not vetted properly.

Browser hygiene (removing unused extensions) enhances privacy and performance.
