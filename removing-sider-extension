Removing ‚ÄúSider: Chat with all AI Models‚Äù Extension
Extension Name: Sider: Chat with all AI Models
Version: 5.8.0-e
Size: 62.7 MB

üß™ Security & Privacy Risk Analysis
While ‚ÄúSider‚Äù is marketed as a powerful sidebar AI tool, its broad and intrusive permissions present a significant cybersecurity and privacy risk to end users. The following points justify its removal:

1. Excessive Permissions
Read your browsing history:
This grants the extension full access to all sites visited, even outside of its intended use. It can build a profile of user behavior, interests, and potentially confidential activity (e.g., banking, research, credentials).

Read and change all data on websites you visit:
This is a critical risk. With this access, the extension can:

Capture input in web forms (e.g., usernames, passwords).

Modify or inject scripts into web pages.

Exfiltrate data without user awareness.

Access file URLs:
May be able to read or alter content of files opened locally in the browser ‚Äî including .html, .pdf, or downloaded documents.

Run in InPrivate Mode:
Although convenient, this allows the extension to operate even during private browsing, defeating the purpose of ‚ÄúInPrivate‚Äù protection.

2. Potential for Data Collection & Misuse
No clear privacy policy or transparency around how data is stored, shared, or processed.

High probability of data being sent to third-party AI APIs without user knowledge.

Sizeable codebase (62.7 MB) increases the surface area for hidden trackers or obfuscated code.

3. Not Open Source
Unlike open-source tools, users cannot inspect or verify what the extension actually does.

Closed-source software with elevated permissions must be treated with greater scrutiny.

üö´ Action: Flagged for Removal
Although the extension may provide utility for AI-based assistance, the security trade-offs outweigh its benefits in a corporate, academic, or privacy-sensitive environment.

‚úÖ Recommendation
Remove this extension immediately unless it is business-critical.

If AI assistance is needed, prefer open-source or officially vetted extensions with limited, justifiable permissions.

Monitor browser extensions regularly to ensure only trusted and necessary tools are active.

Never allow full site access for sidebar or non-core utility extensions without auditing their behavior.
